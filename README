This is a demo of using Google Web Toolkit, Google App Engine and GAE's high performance image serving library to build
a basic image gallery application. Read more about this API here:

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/images/ImagesService.html#getServingUrl(com.google.appengine.api.blobstore.BlobKey, int, boolean)

Note that to deploy this, you will require your GAE application to be billing-enabled. This app was built using GWT 2.0.4 and GAE SDK 1.3.7.
